# AI Agent Instructions — `ai-evaluation-service`

Paste this at the top of the repo (e.g. `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`) so any AI agent working in this codebase follows the same rules as the rest of the team.

---

### Scope of this repo
This repo owns the **AI/LLM domain only**: resume parsing, resume screening, JD/skill matching, fitment scoring, and the AI-driven interview. It does **not** own candidate profiles, job requisitions, interview scheduling, or notifications — those live in `candidate-service`, `recruitment-service`, `interview-service`, and `communication-service` respectively. If a task needs data from one of those domains, call that service's API or consume/publish a Kafka event — never duplicate its logic or query its database here.

This is the **only Python service** in the platform. Every other service is Express + TypeScript — don't import patterns from those repos, and don't let this repo's conventions leak into them.

### Tech stack — do not deviate
- **FastAPI** (not Flask, not Django)
- **Pydantic v2** for every request/response schema — no untyped dicts crossing a route boundary
- **PostgreSQL** — this service's own schema, accessed via SQLAlchemy or a lightweight query layer (confirm with team which — don't introduce a second ORM style mid-service)
- **LangChain/LangGraph** (or direct provider SDK calls) for LLM orchestration — isolate all prompt logic in `prompts/` and `llm/`, never inline a prompt string inside a router or service function
- **pytest** for tests
- **Qdrant client** or **pgvector** for embeddings — confirm which is actually running in `docker-compose.yml` before adding either as a new dependency
- This service's DB is private — no other service, and no other repo's agent, should ever query it directly

```
Every feature = `router.py` (routes only, no business logic) + `service.py` (logic, calls `llm/` and `prompts/`) + `schema.py` (Pydantic models) + `test_<feature>.py`. Routers are registered in `main.py` via `app.include_router(...)` — don't mount routes anywhere else.

### LLM & prompt rules
- **No inline prompts.** Every prompt lives in `prompts/*.txt` (or `.jinja` if templated) and is loaded by the calling service — never construct a prompt string directly inside `service.py`.
- **All LLM calls go through `llm/client.py`.** Don't call `openai.chat.completions...` or any provider SDK directly from a feature module — the wrapper is what lets the team swap providers, add retries, and track token usage in one place.
- **Every fitment score must include reasoning**, never a bare number — this is a product requirement, not just a nice-to-have (see PRD Section 6.3). If a prompt or scoring change would produce a score without an explanation, don't ship it.
- Low-confidence extractions (resume parsing) must be flagged for human review, not silently defaulted — surface a `confidence` field on parsed fields rather than guessing.
- Log token usage and latency per LLM call (span attributes if OpenTelemetry is wired) — bulk resume uploads make cost/latency visible fast, don't fly blind here.

### API contract rules
- Every request/response validated with a Pydantic model — FastAPI will reject invalid payloads automatically, but don't bypass this by accepting raw `dict`/`Request` bodies unless there's a specific streaming reason to.
- This service is called by other Node services over internal HTTP (e.g. `recruitment-service` triggering a fitment sweep) — keep internal endpoints documented in `README.md` separately from any public-facing ones the gateway proxies.
- Don't change an existing endpoint's request/response shape without checking `recruitment-service`'s and `candidate-service`'s HTTP clients that call this service.

### Kafka events
- **Publishes:** `ResumeParsed`, `ResumeScreened`, `FitmentScoreCalculated`, `AIInterviewCompleted`
- **Consumes:** `ResumeUploaded` (from candidate-service) — triggers the parsing pipeline
- Event payloads are the contract — don't change a published event's shape without checking every consumer (`recruitment-service`, `interview-service`, `talent-service`, `analytics-service`).
- All event handling goes in `events/`, not scattered into feature modules.

### Do not modify without team approval
- `database/models.py` structure
- Kafka event names/payload shapes
- `llm/client.py`'s provider interface (other modules depend on its method signatures)
- Fitment scoring weights in `fitment_score/scoring_engine.py` — changing these changes every candidate's score platform-wide, coordinate before touching
- Folder structure above

### Coding standards
- Feature-first, one folder per capability as shown above
- No business logic in routers — router calls service, service calls llm/prompts/db as needed
- Type everything with Pydantic models; no bare `dict` crossing a function boundary that represents a domain object
- Comments only where the "why" isn't obvious (e.g. why a confidence threshold is set where it is) — don't narrate what the code already says
- Every new endpoint gets a matching `test_*.py` before merge, including at least one test with a mocked LLM response (never hit a real LLM API in CI)

### Before opening a PR
- `pytest` passes locally, with LLM calls mocked
- New/changed routes reflected in the service's README and FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- No `.env` values or API keys committed
- If a Kafka event was added or changed, ping the team — don't assume other services will auto-adapt
- If a prompt was changed, note what changed and why in the PR description — prompt changes are effectively logic changes and should be reviewable as such
